# Neural Network Models from Scratch (Python) - Project Overview

This project focuses on creating Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models from scratch using Python, without relying on any pre-built libraries or tools. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how neural networks function and how to construct them without the aid of existing frameworks.

## Project Description

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful machine learning models inspired by the human brain's neural structure. They are used in various applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. In this project, we build two types of ANNs from the ground up:

1. **Simple Single-Layered Feedforward Neural Network (Perceptron):** This model consists of a single layer of neurons, commonly known as a perceptron. We implement the forward and backward propagation steps, learning the model's parameters through gradient descent.

2. **Deep Feedforward Neural Network with Multiple Hidden Layers:** This model is a deeper and more complex neural network with multiple hidden layers. We implement the forward and backward propagation steps for each layer and train the network to learn complex patterns in the data.

## Project Highlights

1. **Understanding Neural Network Fundamentals:** By building the neural network models from scratch, we gain a deeper understanding of the core concepts, including activation functions, backpropagation, gradient descent, and weight initialization.

2. **Python Implementation:** The entire project is implemented in Python, making it accessible and easy to follow for Python enthusiasts and learners.

3. **Customizability:** The code allows for customization of hyperparameters and model architectures. You can experiment with different activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms to improve the model's performance.

4. **Learning by Doing:** Through hands-on implementation, the project provides valuable practical experience in building neural networks, a skill highly sought after in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Usage

The project includes Python scripts for each neural network model. After installing the required prerequisites (Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib), you can run the scripts to observe the neural networks in action. The scripts demonstrate how data flows through the networks during forward propagation and how the models learn from the data during backward propagation (training).

## Conclusion

By completing this project, you will have a solid foundation in understanding neural networks and their inner workings. This knowledge can serve as a stepping stone to more complex deep learning projects and applications. Additionally, the ability to create neural networks from scratch will enable you to appreciate the power of existing deep learning frameworks and libraries better. Happy learning and enjoy building neural networks! ðŸš€
